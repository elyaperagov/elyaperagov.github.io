Сейчас, в\r\n          период пандемии, закрытия границ, ограничения вылетов он стал особенно\r\n          актуальным. Сразу оговоримся: бронировать размещение необходимо как\r\n          можно раньше, непосредственно после завершения формирования новогодних\r\n          пакетов.

Они во многом\r\n          зависят от категории объекта, то есть уровня номеров и обслуживания,\r\n          питания, а также от тех мероприятий, которые предлагаются гостям на\r\n          протяжении всего периода пребывания.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <blockquote>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Вилка цен широкая, поэтому найдется предложение для любого\r\n            выделенного бюджета.

Как правило, периоды\r\n          пребывания в праздники фиксированы. Их два – непосредственно Новый год\r\n          с заездом 30-31 декабря и выездом 3-4 января, Рождество с заездом\r\n          после окончания новогоднего отдыха и выездом в день завершения\r\n          рождественских каникул.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Новогодний заезд в основной массе Подмосковных объектов, даже с\r\n            коттеджным размещением, предлагается с банкетом. В зависимости от\r\n            категории представителя индустрии гостеприимства на банкет\r\n            приглашают или традиционные ансамбли, обеспечивающие живую музыку,\r\n            или звезд эстрады.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Некоторые отели, санатории, пансионаты и пр. включают банкет в\r\n            программу в обязательном порядке, но есть и такие, которые\r\n            предлагают варианты – с банкетом, без банкета, возможность оплатить\r\n            на месте, банкет только для проживающих в основном здании (кроме\r\n            коттеджей).\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Рождественские заезды обычно предлагаются с праздничным ужином и\r\n            веселыми гуляньями, конкурсами, соревнованиями. Особенно интересные\r\n            программы устраивают для детей и семей с детьми.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Дополнительно предлагаем добронировать дни до первого и после\r\n            второго заезда, но опять же не стоит откладывать с решением. Можно\r\n            остаться без номера на Новый год, а следующий свободный появится уже\r\n            только на Рождество.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Есть туристы, которые предпочитают купить сразу два тура на все\r\n            праздники, то есть соединить два пакета и устроить себе длительный\r\n            отдых, даже с лечением. Многие санатории Подмосковья в\r\n            рождественские каникулы открывают лечебные базы и предоставляют\r\n            процедуры.\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Сэкономить на праздничной поездке можно. Это экономия не только на\r\n          категории размещения или банкете, но и на отдельных услугах, которые\r\n          вам могут просто не потребоваться. Например, если вы не планируете\r\n          кататься на лыжах, коньках, а хотите просто спокойно погулять по\r\n          окрестностям, услуга включения инвентаря в стоимость новогоднего тура\r\n          вам не нужна. Поэтому лучше искать объект без этих услуг, где оплата\r\n          проката проводится на месте. Аналогично пользование бассейном, услуги\r\n          SPA, тренажерным залом и так далее.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Что ожидать от погоды на Новый год 2022 в Подмосковье</h2>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Московская область – огромный регион. Климат на большей части\r\n          умеренно-континентальный, и сезонность ярко выражена. Зимы умеренно\r\n          холодные, но при этом погода на Новый год и Рождество стала играть с\r\n          нами злые шутки: то полное отсутствие снега и +10ºС, то -30 ºС и снега\r\n          по пояс.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Случаются и аномалии. Так, за всю историю метеонаблюдений была\r\n          зарегистрирована самая низкая температура по региону (-54°C) в\r\n          Наро-Фоминске.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Что ждет нас в 2022? Ориентируйтесь на средние показатели, но в\r\n            любом случае, если это для вас ведущий параметр выбора, то знайте:\r\n            температура на севере области и на юге может отличаться весьма\r\n            существенно, вплоть до того, что разница достигает 10ºС.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Январь считается самым холодным месяцем, так что придется\r\n            позаботиться о теплой одежде. Средняя температура на западе области\r\n            -9°C, а на востоке -12°C.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            В восточных и юго-восточных районах отмечается более высокая\r\n            континентальность, а это приводит и к более низким температурам в\r\n            зимний период.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Если прорывается арктический воздух, то температура может опуститься\r\n            и до -30°C, но обычно период таких похолоданий непродолжительный.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Негласным полюсом холода Подмосковья называют поселок Черусти\r\n            (крайняя восточная оконечность области). В среднем в январе там\r\n            отмечаются температуры -13-15°C. Места здесь живописные. В районе\r\n            Черусти построено много баз отдыха, включая «Боровое», «Липна»,\r\n            «Русилово», St-Lake и другие. Они предлагают широкие возможности для\r\n            любителей активного зимнего отдыха.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Снежный покров также зависит от капризов погоды. Обычно он\r\n            появляется в ноябре и становится постоянным к концу ноября-началу\r\n            декабря, а исчезает лишь в апреле. Бывают и аномальные отклонения,\r\n            когда на юге Подмосковья снег выпадает, но не задерживается, а сразу\r\n            тает и в декабре, и в январе.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            На западе области, к югу от Оки, - наименьшая высота снежного\r\n            покрова, а наибольшая отмечается в районе Шатуры. Там находится один\r\n            из интересных объектов для размещения на Новый год и Рождество –\r\n            санаторий «Озеро Белое».\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Мы готовы отвечать на все ваши вопросы, дадим подробную консультацию.\r\n          Поможем выбрать лучшее место для вашего зимнего отдыха в Подмосковье\r\n          на Новый год и в рождественские каникулы 2022.
